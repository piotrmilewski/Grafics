### Kingdom Quests Description

  Our project is a terminal questing game in which the character will receive quests throughout the game and will have to traverse the map in order to complete the given quests. The adventure begins in the ‘castle’. Here, the user will be given a series of options to customize their character. As the game progresses, you may come back to the castle to visit the castle shop or heal at the ‘care center’. In order to make purchases, the player/character will have to spend money which is obtained through mob drop when fighting with monsters. Throughout the game, the character may be promoted to improve stats. Stats may include attack, defense, magic, etc. 

  After leaving the castle from the beginning of the game, the player will be given a series of quests to complete and a map with options for where you want to go (ex. forest, cave, etc). You may only go back to the castle when you are not in the process of a quest. These quests involve fighting a series of monsters. As previously mentioned, these monsters will drop money. These monsters may also drop items. These items may include potions, spells, etc. Fighting monsters will also increase experience points which is used to level up the character. In addition, the monsters will follow a similar format to the characters available for the user (all monsters falling under a superclass and different types of monsters will appear). For each quest to be complete, the user must defeat all the monsters in the zone. We will set a range using Math.random(). If the user is unable to defeat all the monsters, the user may lose money or perhaps even an item in their inventory and will be forced to return back to the castle.

  To beat the game, the character will have to complete all the quest. Certain options/quests may only be open to certain levels and some quests may have requirements for your weapon and armor. If you are unable to start a quest, you will have to go to an area where monsters spawn and defeat them in order to get experience and money and potentially new items. You could also sell your old items in order to get the money to buy new items that could be used to start a new quest. Once you reach the end of the game, you will be able to replay everything once again but from your current level. Once a quest is unlocked, it can be played multiple times. In addition, once all quests are finished, you will unlock a final area where you will encounter endless monsters and be able to truly test your skill.
