Kingdom Quests

/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Static vs. Non-static issues
-Organizing 10+ classes so that they each work with each other
- Instead of pressing enter for a new line, we decided to use Thread.sleep() to slow down the print rate.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Although we technically do not need this anymore, we are still unsure of how enter a blank input with Keyboard.
-Weapon implementation
- Run simply quits back to maps in forest. Running in quest will simply avoid the battle. However, we changed it so we lose money instead of quitting the quest.
COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-How to properly handle errors.
-Using git fetch and git rebase in order to fix merge conflicts.
-The ability to slow down the rate in which the line is being read.

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-We changed the structure of our classes (e.g. We put Quest classes under the Map superclass)
-Removed the weapons class and made the weapons strings
-Made the inventory a 2d String array rather than an ArrayList since it was easier to replace and add items with a 2d String array inventory.
-Added a tutorial() to introduce the player to the game rather than starting out in the castle.
-Removed multiple maps and replaced them with Quests since the player doesn't see the visual aspect of the map anyway and thus only needs one map (forest).

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-To make the MVP the priority since at first we wanted to complete all the classes except for Woo.
-The UML diagram and flow chart come in handy.
